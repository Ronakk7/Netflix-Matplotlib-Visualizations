# Netflix-Matplotlib-Visualizations
This project explores the Netflix Titles Dataset using Matplotlib, inspired by the popular Matplotlib Tutorial by Keith Galli.  The goal is to apply the same plotting styles and techniques from the tutorial to real-world data â€” analyzing trends and patterns in Netflix content.
